## Introduction
My standing desk is pretty neat, but would be neater if controllable over wifi. First, one has to measure the required torque and order a suitable motor. Second, one has to set up a Raspberry Pico W to control the motordriver which supplies the power to the motor. Thirdly, one has to put all the component together and make a mount on the desk that can stand the relative high torque. Also plan on controlling the pico from a normal raspberry pie.

## Components
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 Wireless
- JGB37-545 high torque motor. 12V, 67 RPM.
- L298N IC motordriver
- Voltage boosters (pico pins operate on 3.3V, L298N on 5V)
- 12V wallwart adapter rated for 3A
- Barreljack converter 
- Raspberry Pi 4B
- Breadboard kit (for testing)

Look at the comp.jpeg photo for the components.

 ## Usage
Still in development ;)
